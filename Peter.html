		<h1>Meet Peter</h1>
		<h2>Who is Peter?</h2>
		<p>Peter is one of the four characters and is based on Peter rabbit from the Peter rabbit movies</p>
		<h2>What is Peter?</h2>
		<p>Peter is an anthropomorphic rabbit (and part kangaroo).</p>
		<h2>What is Peter's gender?</h2>
		<p>Peter is male in our terms, but female in his species (male and female are reversed in their species). So, Peter goes by either he/him or they/them</p>
		<h2>What are Peter's specialties?</h2>
		<p>Peter has a kangaroo pouch, and, unlike an actual kangaroo's fleshy/hairless pouch, his pouch is soft with the same velvety soft rabbit fur on the inside of the pouch as the rest of his body. Peter can also jump high and has amazing hearing.</p>
		<h2>How big is Peter?</h2>
		<p>Peter is 6'5" (6 feet and 5 inches) tall (or around 200 cm tall).</p>
		<h2>Peter's body style?</h2>
		<img src="BodyTypes.jpeg" alt="Body Style Guide">
		<p>Peter's body style looks similar to the AI image below (but has a rabbit tail instead of a kangaroo tail). Also, just like all my characters, he has a featureless crotch.</p>

		<h2>Peter's feet paw style?</h2>
		<img src="FeetPaws.jpeg" alt="Feet Paws Style Guide">
		<p>Peter's feet paws are rabbit feet (a bit of scuttlers, steppers, stomper, and loafers all together), and look like that of the image below.</p>

		<h2>Peter's hand paw style?</h2>
		<img src="HandPaws.jpeg" alt="Hand Paws Style Guide">
		<p>Peter's hand paws are like that of Peter rabbit from the Peter rabbit movies. Just look as the similar characters at the end of this page.</p>

		<h2>What is Peter's color makeup?</h2>
		<p>Peter's fur colors are those of Peter rabbit from the Peter rabbit movies with more white.</p>
		<img src="PeterRabbit.jpeg" alt="Peter Rabbit">
		<h2>What does Peter wear?</h2>
		<p>Peter usually wears his blue jacket (the exact ones that Peter rabbit from the Peter rabbit movie wears). Their jacket is like their security blanket, so without it they feel uncomfortable wearing no clothing unless with their closest friends.</p>
		<h2>What does Peter like?</h2>
		<p>Peter likes to live a life of adventure, and also loves nature. he also has a slight obsession with his feet paws (or what he calls his "lucky rabbit feet").</p>
		<h2>What does Peter dislike?</h2>
		<p>He is afraid of being alone.</p>
		<h2>What is Peter's personality?</h2>
		<p>Peter is a bit self-centered, but very kind, loving, enthusiastic, and energetic. he loves talking about himself, and is proud to be a rabbit.</p>

		<h2>What drawings I need</h2>
		<p>Some positions I would like include a reference sheet of Peter (standing straight with army by their side), a drawing of them sitting, pointing, speaking, a side-lying position, and one showing their feet paws.</p>
