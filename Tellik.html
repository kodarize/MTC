		<h2>What drawings I need</h2>
		<p>Some positions I would like include a reference sheet of Tellik (standing straight with army by their side), a drawing of them sitting, pointing, speaking, side-lying position, and one showing their feet paws. Also, I would love a drawing or more of him laying on the Tellik logo eating an apple (use the following two images as a reference).</p>
