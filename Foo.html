		<h1>Meet Foo</h1>
		<h2>Who is Foo?</h2>
		<p>Foo is my alter-ego</p>
		<h2>What is Foo?</h2>
		<p>Foo is an anthropomorphic foxcoon (part fox part raccoon).</p>
		<h2>What is Foo's gender?</h2>
		<p>Foo is male</p>
		<h2>What are Foo's specialties?</h2>
		<p>Foo is nocturnal and has natural night vision. He also has the ability to bring things together. For example, he is able to make a falling apart object whole again (rip in your shirt no more), and he can even repair a broken relationship. However, the side effect to this ability is that it is always radiating from him. In other words, nearby object are always slowly repairing and nearby creatures slowly build a relationship with him no matter if they want to or not. Also, Foo's navy blue fur has the ability to glow.</p>
		<h2>How big is Foo?</h2>
		<p>Foo is 6'5" (6 feet and 5 inches) tall (or around 200 cm tall).</p>
		<h2>Foo's body style?</h2>

		<h2>What does Foo wear?</h2>
		<p>Foo wears nothing. Foo feels the opposite way humans feel about clothing, he is in touch with his animal self, and feels weird when wearing clothing.</p>
		<h2>What does Foo like?</h2>
		<p>Foo likes to live a life of leisure (the word "Freizeit" describes him well), and also loves nature.</p>
		<h2>What does Foo dislike?</h2>
		<p>He dislikes the side effects of his abilities, as he is never sure if those around him actually like him or if they just spent too much time with him and are under his spell. He also dislikes wearing clothing, but doesn't care about the clothing choices of others.</p>
		<h2>What is Foo's personality?</h2>
		<p>Foo is a happy and chill creature.</p>

		<h2>What drawings I need</h2>
		<p>Some positions I would like include a reference sheet of Foo (standing straight with army by their side), a drawing of them sitting, pointing, speaking, a side-lying position, and one showing their feet paws. Also, I would love a drawing or more of him laying on the Tellik logo eating an apple (use the following two images as a reference).</p>
